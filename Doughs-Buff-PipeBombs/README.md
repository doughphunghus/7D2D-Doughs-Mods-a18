**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet adds more pipe bombs and does some rebalancing of the vanilla (iron pipe) pipe bomb so there is some progression/balance for crafting these items.


**Tested on**:
| This Mod version | Game version | Note |
|:------------------- |:------------------:| -------------:|
| v18.3.1.0 | alpha 18.3 b4 | Likely works with all 18.2+ versions |

**Known issues:**
On my dev machine (Ubuntu) there were sometimes persisting visual oddities in the area where blocks were destroyed. I believe this is either an issue with the game when destroying many blocks or, more likely, my video card/PC setup has rendering issues. Usually these were visual oddities would clear up after leaving the affected area and coming back and were:
- Blocks that were destroyed appearing to still exist, but not there (you could walk through them).
- Blocks "shimmering" as if they were shiny or reflective
- Blocks losing their normal texture (like a door appearing just as a grey texture)

Note: I have not seen this occur with ground (dirt, stone, etc) blocks.
