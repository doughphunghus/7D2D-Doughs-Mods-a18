**For game:** 7 Days to Die

**Description:**
Have a bad case of wanderlust or don't want to carry a map with you?
Or just want to make things more challenging?

If so...

This modlet obscures the player wold map and disallows interaction with it.
- You can no longer see the biomes, POI's, roads, etc.  Its all greyed out
- You can no longer set/share waypoints since the map is not interactive.
- You can no longer see the stats that were inside the map (elevation, temp, wind, day/time), however
the temperature is accessible via the player stats menu, and the day/time is in the main game UI
so all you lose is elevation and wind.
- You can still see your location coordinates on the map screen
- You can likely (not tested) see other allies on the map

You essentially have to rely on the compass for bedroll location (if you have one)
and quests/airdrops/backpack locations as they show up as exclamation points on the compass.
In addition, you should see the "distance" to an active quest marker in the main game UI.
