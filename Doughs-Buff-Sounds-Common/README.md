**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This is an attempt to come up with more "normal sounding" extra game sounds by
remixing common sounds heard in the game in order to make repetitive/common
actions have a little more variety and increase immersion.

If you hear a sound that is a "little too off" or "weird" let me know.
Please reference the item/action that causes the sound.
More sounds will be made as I have time. I am not a sound engineer so these
are not super high quality.

Currently this mod only adds sounds to these additional items.

| Item/block          | Action             | Added sounds  |
|:------------------- |:------------------:| -------------:|
| wrench              | Harvesting         | 9             |
| backpacks container | Opening+Closing    | 8             |
| cupboards           | Opening+Closing    | 14            |
